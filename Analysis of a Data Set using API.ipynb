First, it was coined by Catholic activists disputing Oregon's Measure 16 in 1994 - so it carries a political bias. Second, the laws in Oregon, Washington and Vermont each do not contain the term \"\"assisted suicide\"\" but use aid in dying. Third, assisting a suicide remains illegal in all three states - and also Montana and New Mexico. No state attorney general or county district attorney has charged any physician or pharmacist who acted within the aid in dying laws of the three states. Finally, describing people who use aid in dying, such as Brittany Maynard, suicides grossly misrepresents their experience and devalues both their lives and deaths. Continued usage of the biased and inaccurate term should be amended throughout Wikipedia.   \" 0.18095295\n",

Where on earth did you dig that nonsense up from? There are plenty of good examples around, but medium to large switch mode power supplies are often supplied with nominally 3 Amp cable in a moulded on plug, many with an IEC 60320 C7 type plug (rated by that standard at 2.5 Amps). According to you, the plug should therefore be fitted with a 3 Amp fuse (determined by the cable). If you did so, you would never get any but the smallest power supplies running. You have to fit a 5 Amp fuse because the very large >40 Amp momentary inrush current lasts long enough that it will blow a 3 Amp fuse. The cable and plug can retain their original ratings because the inrush current will not harm them. The rating of the fuse is determined by much much more than the cable size alone. Indeed, the type of power supply that is built into a plug usually has no fuse at all!   17:17\" 0.32341075\n",

All major figures from the Clinton Admin who posited an al Qaeda-Saddam link have since changed their minds.  You have to realize that our understanding of al Qaeda was in a pretty primitive state before 9/11, because so few took them seriously, and the ones who did, perceived them through older models of analysis (the \"\"state sponsored terrorism\"\" thesis) that are not as relevant to a diffuse network like al-Qaeda.  People cite the fact that Richard Clarke used to think there was a link as if it proves that the link must be true.  Oddly, these are the same people who dispute Clarke's credibility now.
